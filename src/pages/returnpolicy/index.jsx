Feel free to try on a product but all we ask is that the product remains unused and is preserved in its original condition along with the tags and packaging. In case a Seal Tag is received with the item, ensure that it remains attached & intact with the product to avoid any hassles in the event of a return/exchange. There are two ways to return the product to us:

                During Pick Up, our delivery agent may do a quality check on the return. For a successful pick up, we will initiate a doorstep refund for the return amount into the refund mode selected at the time of initiating the return request. This doorstep refund may not be applicable for some pin codes in which case refund will be initiated after the product has been received at seller’s warehouse and has passed a quality check. If the picked up product does not pass the quality check, we shall ship it back to you. If you choose to exchange the item for reason of mismatch of size or receipt of a defective item, you will be provided with a replacement of the item, free of cost. However all exchanges are subject to stock availability and subject to your address being serviceable for an exchange. If you choose to exchange an item, our delivery representative will deliver the new item to you and simultaneously pick up the original item from you. Please note that we offer you an option to exchange items purchased by you on Huvo for same or different sizes of same style or for any other item of the same or different value from Huvo within the specified exchange period subject to your address being serviceable for an exchange.
